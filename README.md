# Sentiment-Analysis

Analysing the sentiments of the passenger tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Description

A dataset having tweets of about 6 US Airlines is analysed for the passenger sentiments.
The dataset is split in 2 parts, for training and testing. Naive Bayes classifier 
is also built on the training data.  

## About

For this project I have - 
1) Used Python3 for coding along with packages like pandas, sklearn, etc. 
2) Internal code documentation.

## Contents
The uploaded folder consists of - 

1) A code file, named sentiment_analysis.ipynb.
2) A csv file containing tweets used for training the model, named Tweets-train.csv.
3) A csv file containing tweets used for testing the model and its accuracy, named Tweets-test.csv.

## Requirements

Apart from Python3, you will need sklearn, nltk, pandas and numpy installed in the system.
